The tiny Kingdom of  Bhutan lies hidden in the folds of the eastern Himalayas sandwiched between the  two giant countries of India in the south and China in the north. With a total  area of 38,398 sq kilometers, approximately the size of Switzerland, Bhutan  lies between 88° 45' and 92°10' longitude east and 26°40' and 28°15 ' north. It  is a mountainous country except for a small flat strip in the southern  foothills. In the north we border with Tibet, the autonomous region under  China, the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh and in the south with the Indian  states of Assam and West Bengal.</div>
