Physically, Bhutan can  be divided into three zones: Alpine Zone (4000m and above) with no forest  cover; the Temperate Zone (2000 to 4000m) with conifer or broadleaf forests;  and the Subtropical Zone (150m to 2000m) with Tropical or Subtropical  vegetation. Because of its wide altitudinal and climatic range, the flora and  fauna is diverse and rich.<br /><br />
Forest types in Bhutan  are Fir Forests, Mixed Conifer Forest, Blue Pine Forest, Chirpine Forest,  Broadleaf mixed with Conifer, Upland Hardwood Forest, Lowland Hardwood Forest,  and Tropical Lowland Forests. Almost 60% of the plant species that is found in  the eastern Himalayan region can be found in Bhutan as well.<br /><br />
Bhutan boasts of about  300 species of medicinal plants and about 46 species of rhododendrons. Some  common sights for the visitors are the magnolias, junipers, orchids of varied  hues, gentian, medicinal plants, daphne, giant rhubarb, the blue poppy which is  the national flower and tropical trees such as pine and oaks.<br /><br />
A wide range of animal  could also be found frequenting the jungles of Bhutan. Some high altitude  species are the snow leopards, the Bengal tigers that are found at altitude  ranging 3000 to 4000 meters, the red panda, the gorals and the langurs, the  Himalayan black bear and sambars, the wild pigs and the barking deer, the blue  sheep and the musk deer. In the tropical forests of Southern Bhutan one can  come across the clouded leopards, the one horned rhinoceros, elephants, golden  langur that is unique to Bhutan, the water buffaloes and the swamp deer.<br /><br />
Bhutan also has a great  variety of bird species. It is recognized as an area of high biological  diversity and is known as the East Himalayan &lsquo;hot spot&rsquo; situated as it is at  the hub of 221 global endemic bird areas. The recorded number of bird species  is over 670 and there are chances that this number could still go up.<br /><br />
In addition, 57% of  Bhutan&rsquo;s globally threatened birds and 90% of the country&rsquo;s restricted rare  birds are dependent on forests. Bhutan has about 415 resident bird species.  These inhabitant birds are altitudinal refugees, moving up and down the  mountains depending upon the seasons and weather conditions. Of about 50  species of birds that migrate in winters are the buntings, waders and ducks,  thrushes and the birds of prey. Some 40 species are partial migrants and they  include species such as swifts, cuckoos, the bee-eaters, fly catchers and the  warblers.<br /><br />
Bhutan is also home to  about 16 bird species that are endangered worldwide. These include the White  bellied heron, Pallas Fish eagle, Blyth&rsquo;s King fisher to name a few. Phobjikha  valley in Wangdue Phodrang and Bomdeling in Trashi Yangtse are also two  important places in Bhutan that is visited by the endangered Black Necked  Crane.<br /><br />
