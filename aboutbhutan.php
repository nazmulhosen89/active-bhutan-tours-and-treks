Bhutan – The Land of Thunder Dragon has remained isolated from the rest of the world    in its pristine state, unspoiled by outside influences. The kingdom opened    its door to tourism only in 1974, since then the number of visitors to Bhutan    has steadily increased. Bhutan is endowed with breathtaking natural beauty,    surrounded by sacred mountains, virgin peaks and holy lakes. Its beautiful    valleys and lush forests are teeming with wildlife and flora. Its    approximately 38,600 Square kilometer of area is covered with not less than    72% of dense forest and jungles. In less than 65 miles, Bhutan rises 25,000    feet from the subtropical jungles of the south to arctic cold of the high    Himalayas. More than 85% of the populations of about <strong>672,425</strong> people    are farmers who live in small villages spread over rugged mountain. Since the    8th century Buddhist teachings and philosophy has played a vital role in    shaping the country's culture and the way of life. In fact it is the only    surviving Vajrayana Buddhist Kingdom in the world.<br /><br />
