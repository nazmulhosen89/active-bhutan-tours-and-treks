Bhutanese economy is  characterized by its small size given its small population size. With the  majority of the Bhutanese people illiterate and residing in rural areas, about  31% of the population still lives under poverty line. However, in general all  Bhutanese have a shelter and are self – sufficient to a large extent. With  rapid modernization the living standard of the people has also stared to grow  in the recent years and every village have now access to basic amenities such  as Schools, Basic Health Units, feeder roads and electricity. Plans are also  underway to connect even the remotest villages with a good net work of  telecommunication and mobile phones.<br /><br />
Bhutanese economy is  dominantly agrarian. With a bulk of the population being farmers, agriculture  is the main stay of their sustenance followed by a large extent with animal  husbandry. Animal products such as cheese, butter and milk not only form a  major diet for the farmers but also contribute to their income. With many  farmers groups and cooperatives being encouraged by the Ministry of Agriculture  and Forest, people have been encouraged to set up cooperative stalls where they  can easily market their farm products.<br /><br />
  
  The main crops are rice, maize, wheat and buckwheat while cash crops are predominantly  potatoes, apples, and citrus such as oranges, cardamom, ginger, and chili. With  the setting up of a fruit based industry in the capital, farmers from the  nearby areas are able to market their fruit products and thereby earn  additional revenue.<br /><br />
Given the rich  bio-diversity, Bhutanese have also been able to tap the forestry resources.  Cane and bamboo works therefore form a source of income. Various cane and  bamboo products now find their way into the market that is usually bought by  the urban dwellers and the tourists.<br /><br />
In the recent years,  however, a major contributing factor to the Bhutanese economy has been the  tourism industry. Since its opening in 1975, the country has made significant  expansion in tourism industry. It not only generates the much needed revenue  for Bhutan, but to an extent has been able to create employment for most  Bhutanese graduates and the educated lot.<br /><br />
But undeniably, the  power sector has been the biggest contributor to the Bhutanese exchequer. The  Chhukha Hydro Power Corporation, the Tala Hydro Power Corporation, the Baso Chu  Hydro Power Corporation and the Kurichu Hydro Power Corporation under the  umbrella of Druk Green Power Corporation are some of the mega projects that  churn out about 1500 MW of power, most of which are exported to our neighboring  country India. With abundant water resources, Bhutan still has the capacity to  generate about 30,000 MW of electricity.<br /><br />
Another sector that  contributes to the revenue is the contribution from the manufacturing sector.  With the industrial sector established in Pasakha, some of the small scale  industries that have cropped up are cement plants, calcium and carbide, steel  and Ferro silicon, coca cola and also wood based industries.<br />
  As a result of the  economic development, with US $ 1,321, today we have one of the highest per  capita incomes in South Asia.</div>
