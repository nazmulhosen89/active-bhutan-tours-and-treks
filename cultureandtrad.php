While Bhutan is  definitely one of the smallest countries in the world, yet the cultural  diversity and its richness are profound. As such strong emphasis is laid on the  promotion and preservation of its rich cultural diversity. It is believed that  ensuring protection and preservation of our unique culture would assist in  protecting the sovereignty of the nation.<br /><br />

<b style="color:#eb731a">Birth</b><br /><br />

The birth of a new born  baby is always welcomed heartily. Bhutanese value children as progenitors of  future and therefore does not discriminate between a girl child and a boy  child. Mothers are always looked after carefully and because of the strong  belief, outsiders and guests are kept at bay for the first three days as it is  believed that the house is polluted. On the third day after the child's birth,  a short purification ritual is performed after which the outsiders pay visits  to the new born child and the mother. Gifts are offered ranging from dairy  products to cloth and money.<br /><br />
The child is not  immediately named as naming a child is always the prerogative of a highly  religious person. The mother and the child also visits a local temple to  receive blessings from the local deity (natal deity) and the name associated  with the deity is given. In some cases, the child is given the name of the day  on which the child is born. Based on the Bhutanese calendar, a horoscope is  written that details out the time and the date of the birth, various rituals to  be performed at different time in the life of the child and to an extent predicting  his future.<br /><br />

<b style="color:#eb731a">Marriage</b><br /><br />

Arranged marriages were  popular just a few decades back. Normally, people married among the relatives.  Cross-cousin marriage is a popular tradition amongst the people of eastern  Bhutan. This is now becoming unpopular among the literate mass and most of the  marriages take place on their accord depending on their choice.<br /><br />
Marriages are simple  affairs and are kept low-key. However, elaborate rituals are performed for  lasting unions amongst the bride and the bridegroom. As the religious ceremony  comes to an end, parents, relatives and the friends present the newlyweds with  traditional offerings of scarves along with gifts in the form of cash and  goods.<br /><br />
In the western part of  Bhutan, the husband goes out to the wife's house after marriage while the  practice in eastern Bhutan is that the wife usually accompanies the husband.  The newlyweds may also choose to live on their own. An accepted norm of the  Bhutanese way of life is divorces that carry no ignominy or disgrace and in  most instances they move on with a new life partner.<br /><br />

<b style="color:#eb731a">Funeral</b><br /><br />

Death signifies re-birth  or a mere passing on to a new life. In keeping with the traditions, elaborate  rituals are performed to ensure a safe passage and a good rebirth.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Important days such as the 7th day, 14th day, 21st day and 49th days are  earmarked where prayer flags in the name of the deceased are erected and  rituals performed.<br /><br />
The deceased are  normally cremated while the southern Bhutanese bury and the Brokpas chop off  and feed them to the vultures. Elaborate rituals are also conducted on the  death anniversary with erection of prayer flags. The relatives and people of  the locality come with alcohol, rice, or other sundry items to attend these  rituals.<br /><br />

<b style="color:#eb731a">Bhutanese  Dress</b><br /><br />

A distinctive feature of  the Bhutanese is their dress that has evolved over the years. The Gho or the  dress worn by the Bhutanese men reaches just till their knees while Kira, the  dress worn by women reaches till their ankles. The Gho is folded and tied at  the waist by a traditional belt known as Kera and the pouch that is formed is  used for carrying small articles such as wallet, mobiles and Doma, the beetle  nut. Traditionally it was used for carrying bowls and a small dagger inserted  in between as was the custom then.<br />
<br />
But the dress for the tribal and semi nomadic people like the Bramis and  Brokpas of eastern Bhutan are generally different from the rest of the  Bhutanese population. The Brokpas and the Bramis wear dresses woven either out  of Yak or Sheep hair.<br /><br />
In keeping with the  tradition, it is mandatory for all Bhutanese to wear scarves while visiting  Dzongs and other administrative centers. The scarf worn by men is known as  Kabney while that of women is known as Rachu. The scarves worn are different in  color and signify their status or rank. While the general Bhutanese men wear  scarf that is white in color, the King and the Je Khenpo or the Head Abbot wear  yellow scarves. The ministers wear orange scarves while the Judges wear green  and the district administrators wear red scarves with a small white strip that  runs through. The Rachu is hung over their shoulder and unlike scarves worn by  men does not have any color attached to it. They are usually woven out of raw  silk with rich patterns.<br /><br />

<b style="color:#eb731a">Eating  habits</b><br /><br />

Traditional Bhutanese  eating habits are simple and generally eat with their hands. The family members  eat sitting cross legged on the wooden floors with food being first served to  the head of the household. It is usually women who serves food and in most  cases the mother. Before eating, a short prayer is offered and a small morsel  placed on the wooden floor as offerings to the spirits and deities. With  modernization, eating habits have changed and in urban areas, people usually  eat with spoons and make use of dining tables and chairs.<br /><br />
Traditionally dishes  were cooked in earthenware's, but with the easy availability of imported pans  and pots, the use of earthenware's have been replaced. Usual meals consist of rice,  a dish of chili and cheese known as Ema Datshi, pork or beef curry or lentils.<br /><br />

<b style="color:#eb731a">Festivals</b><br /><br />

Bhutan is rich in  cultural diversity and this richness is further enhanced by the variety of  festivals that is being observed. Every village is known for their unique  festivals though the most widely known is the Tshechu. As the Tshechu begins,  the villagers and the general populace dressed in their finery congregate in  the temples and monasteries to witness these festivals. Tshechus are usually  occasions to mark the important events in the life of the second Buddha, the  precious Indian Tantric master known as Guru Rinpoche or the Precious Gem.  Various mask dances are performed together with songs and dances for three  days. It provides the villagers with a respite from their hard day's labor and  to catch up with their family and friends. People share their food of Red rice,  pork and Ema Datshi and drown themselves in the revelry of their traditional  wine known as Ara.
