Besides others that  Bhutan can offer to the world, is its pristine environment that is almost  intact. Our ecosystem is rich and diverse, because of its location, great  geographical and climatic variations. Bhutan&rsquo;s high, rugged mountains and valleys  boast of spectacular biodiversity, earning it a name as one of the world&rsquo;s ten  most important biodiversity hotspots.<br /><br />
Recognizing the  importance of environment, conservation of its rich biodiversity is one of its  development paradigms. The government has assured of maintaining 60% of its  forest resources for all times to come through the recently enacted law passed  by the National Assembly.&nbsp; As of today, about 65% of the total land area  is under forest cover and about 26% of the land area fall under the protected  area. The protected area comprises of four parks that is designated as home for  the wild life sanctuaries.<br /><br />

  <b style="color:#eb731a">National  Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries</b><br /><br />

Each of Bhutan&rsquo;s  National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries is an essential part of the Bhutan Biological  Conservation Complex – a system of national parks, protected areas and forest  corridors covering 35 percent of the country. Each of these parks and  sanctuaries has its own special character and are homes to endangered animals,  birds and plants.<br /><br />

  <b style="color:#eb731a">Jigme  Singye Wangchuck National Park</b><br /><br />

Located in the central  part of the country, Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park covers 1,300 sq.km  and is the second largest protected area of Bhutan. The natural habitats in the  park range from high permanent ice peaks to low conifer and broadleaf forests.  The park was formally known as the Black Mountain National Park. The varying  altitude and rainfall in the areas have created a wide diversity of climatic  conditions, making it a suitable home for many species of plants, animals and  birds.<br /><br />
The park has one of the  highest coverage of mature fir, pine and other types of broadleaf forests  making it one of the last largest undisturbed tracks of forest in the Eastern  Himalayan region. Both musk deer and Himalayan black bear can be found here.  The golden langur that is endemic to Bhutan, the rare clouded leopard, the red  panda and the Royal Bengal tiger are also found in the park. This National Park  is an important link between the northern and southern tiger population in Bhutan.  The eastern side of the park supports about 20% of Bhutan&rsquo;s tiger population.<br /><br />
The national park is  also home to 391 bird species of which seven species are among the globally  threatened species. Phobjikha valley, in the buffer zone of the park, is the  winter habitat of the black necked cranes. More than 260 cranes winter in  Phobjikha every year.<br /><br />

  <b style="color:#eb731a">TrumshingLa  National Park</b><br /><br />

Situated at the very  heart of the nation and covering 768 sq. km, ThrumshingLa National Park is  Bhutan&rsquo;s newest National Park, officially gazetted in July 1998. Pristine  forests ranging from alpine to subtropical broadleaf combine with dramatic  mountains, snow leopards, tigers, red pandas and rare plants to create a  globally important and unique habitat.<br /><br />
With its elevation  ranging from less than 1,000 m to more than 4,000 m, and temperatures between –  21ْ C and 28ْ C, the park has some of the most diverse climatic variations  and habitats in the world. The park made news in the year 2000 when a  WWF-supported survey team captured a camera-trap image of a tiger at 3,000  meters – the first photographic evidence that the magnificent creatures exist  at such high altitudes. Besides that, the park has 341 species of birds making  it truly a birdwatcher&rsquo;s paradise.<br>
  ThrumshingLa National  Park has some of the most breathtaking scenery and natural habitats in the  world. It is a source of awe and inspiration for numerous tourists and trekkers  and tourism helps to sustain the lives of the communities within the park. With  an effective management plan, dedicated park staff and WWF support, it should  stay that way for generations to come.<br /><br />

  <b style="color:#eb731a">Royal  Manas National Park</b><br /><br />

Bhutan&rsquo;s Crown Jewel,  the Manas National Park represents the largest example of tropical and  sub-tropical ecosystems in Bhutan. With its thousands of animal and plant  species, many globally endangered, it is not only the most diverse protected  area in the Kingdom but also one of the world&rsquo;s biologically outstanding sites.<br /><br />
Lying in south central  Bhutan, Manas is connected at the southern border with India&rsquo;s Manas Tiger  Reserve, a World Heritage Site. To the north it borders the Jigme Singye  Wangchuck National Park. Royal Manas was designated a wildlife sanctuary in  1966 making it Bhutan&rsquo;s oldest protected area. The area was upgraded to a  National Park in 1993.<br /><br />
There are wide climate  variations in Royal Manas. The May-September monsoons bring up to 5,000mm of  rain. Rainfall is negligible in winter and the climate is extremely pleasant  from November till February.<br>
  Manas is also extremely  rich in wildlife species, including the highly endangered Royal Bengal tiger,  Asian elephant, greater one-horned rhinoceros, clouded leopard, Himalayan black  bear, gangetic dolphin and pangolin. Found virtually nowhere else in the world  is the especially rare golden langur, a primate of extraordinary grace and  beauty with its long, silky blond fur.<br>
  <br>
  More than 365 species of birds have been officially recorded in Royal Manas  National Park with an additional 200 believed to be in residence. Species found  here include the globally threatened rufous-necked hornbill, Pallas fishing  eagle, great white-bellied heron, spotted wren-babbler, blue-headed rock thrush  and emerald cuckoo. Many of the park&rsquo;s more than 900 types of plants have  commercial, medicinal, traditional and religious significance.<br /><br />
WWF and Bhutan&rsquo;s Nature  Conservation Division jointly developed a five-year conservation management  plan for this very special haven on earth. The plan includes training and  equipping park staff, improving park infrastructure, and supporting biological  and socio-economic surveys and park monitoring programmes.<br /><br />

  <b style="color:#eb731a">Jigme  Dorji National Park</b><br /><br />

With an area of 4,349  sq. km, the Jigme Dorji National Park is the largest protected area in Bhutan.  It is one of the most biologically rich areas in the Eastern Himalayan region,  and stretches from warm broad-leaved forests to permanent ice fields and  glaciers on Bhutan&rsquo;s north-western border. The monsoon rains and a varied  topographical gradient, from just over 1,000 meters to more than 7,000 meters  above sea level, account for this rich plant and animal diversity.<br /><br />
Sacred peaks such as  Jomolhari, Tsherimgang and Jichu Drakey are prominent landmarks in the park.  Glaciers and glacial lakes are interspersed in the mountains forming important  head waters for some of Bhutan&rsquo;s main rivers.<br /><br />
The alpine region houses  numerous flowers such as the national flower blue poppy, edelweiss, orchids,  rhododendrons etc.<br>
  Charismatic animal species like the snow leopard, takin, tiger, black bears and  red panda inhabit the forests and mountains of the park. This may be the only  place in the world where the Royal Bengal tiger and snow leopard habitats  overlap. Most of Bhutan&rsquo;s most popular trekking routes can be found inside the  Jigme Dorji National Park.<br /><br />

  <b style="color:#eb731a">Bumdeling  Wildlife Sanctuary</b><br /><br />

Bumdeling Wildlife  Sanctuary is located in north-western part of Bhutan covering an area of 1,545  sq. km with 420 sq. km of buffer zone encompassing parts of Trashi Yangtse,  Lhuentshe, and Mongar district. It shares international borders with the  Tibetan region of China in the north and India in the north east. The sanctuary  is home to around 100 species of mammals, including globally endangered species  such as snow leopard, Royal Bengal tiger and red panda.<br /><br />
About 150 black necked  cranes spend their winter in Bumdeling every year from mid November to early  March. Bumdeling Wildlife Sanctuary is also a paradise for butterflies: as of  now 130 species are recorded and another 120 are expected to be found there.  Besides natural beauty and diversity many significant religious and cultural  places can be found inside the sanctuary, such as Rigsum Gompa, the mystic  Singye Dzong and Dechenphodrang Lhaghang– maybe most scenic monastery in the  whole country.<br /><br />

  <b style="color:#eb731a">Sakteng  Wildlife Sanctuary</b><br /><br />

Located in the  easternmost part of the Kingdom, Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary spans an area of  650 sq. km and is Bhutan&rsquo;s newest protected area (launched in 2003). The  sanctuary is a lost world of biodiversity waiting to be discovered. It presents  a wide diversity of Himalayan terrestrial ecosystems, namely alpine meadow,  temperate forest, and warm broadleaf forest.<br /><br />
The Sanctuary is home to  people of isolated nomadic tribes. It is characterized by thick carpets of  rhododendrons, and in its habitat roam snow leopards, red pandas, Himalayan  black bear, barking deer, Himalayan red fox, the hoary-bellied Himalayan  squirrel and even the mythical Yeti (or the &ldquo;Abominable Snowman&rdquo;). Sakteng is  virtually untouched by development. Bird species include the Assamese macaw,  blood pheasant, grey backed shrike, grey headed woodpecker, common hoopoe,  rufous vented tit and dark breasted rose finch.<br /><br />
Plant life includes  Bhutan&rsquo;s national flower, the blue poppy, rhododendrons, primulas and gentiana,  all of which transform the park into a garden of colours during spring time.  There are also many plants with medicinal values- such as cordyceps.
